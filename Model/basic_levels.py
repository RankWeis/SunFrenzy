"""
Eventually need to create some sort of level editor.
For simplicity, array string of nxm size can be used.
W = wall
G = ground (could be wall I guess)
B = Block, could be more descriptive later
I = invisible block, somehow need to feed in conditions, but for now can be on all enemies killed
E = Enemy
S = Starting Position

First level is not side scrolling, to get things up and running.

level1 = [
"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW",
"W                    W",
"W                    W",
"W F   E              W"
"W  BBBBB   II   BB   W"
"W                  BBW"
"W                    W"
"W  S                 W"
"WGGGGGG GGGG    GGGW"
